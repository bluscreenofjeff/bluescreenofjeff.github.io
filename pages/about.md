# About

I'm a pentester and red teamer at Veris Group's [Adaptive Threat Division](https://www.verisgroup.com/adaptive-threat-division/).

In my free time, I spin up scripts, tutorials, and tradecraft to help pay forward all the help and guidance I've received.

Hit me up on Twitter at [@bluscreenofjeff](https://twitter.com/bluscreenofjeff), or don't.
